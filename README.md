# Introduction

Roblox studio is a powerful game engine, but you need to know "Luau" (it's interpretation of Lua) to be able to create things.

Use the Docs! A lot of events and function and useful things can be found there, check it out! https://create.roblox.com/docs

This was made entirely for fun and as a memory check for me! Please don't make this be where you start with lua, it's a decent starting place since I explain stuff in an easy way but there's better documentaries like the docs mentioned above.
